# Core Talent AI Coder Challenge: Camera Movement Detection

**Detecting Significant Camera Movement Using Image Recognition**

---

## Scenario

Imagine you are tasked with building a component for a smart camera system. Your goal is to detect **significant movement**â€”for example, if someone moves or tilts the camera or if the entire camera is knocked or shifted. This is different from simply detecting moving objects in the scene.

---

## Requirements

1. **Input:**

   * A sequence of images or frames (at least 10-20), simulating a fixed camera, with some frames representing significant camera movement (tilt, pan, large translation), and others showing a static scene or minor background/object motion.
   * You may use public datasets, generate synthetic data, or simulate with your own webcam.

     * Example: [CameraBench Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/syCen/CameraBench)
2. **Task:**

   * Build an algorithm (**Python preferred**) that analyzes consecutive frames and detects when significant camera movement occurs.
   * Output a list of frames (by index/number) where significant movement is detected.
3. **Expected Features:**

   * **Basic:** Frame differencing or feature matching to detect large global shifts (e.g., using OpenCVâ€™s ORB/SIFT/SURF, optical flow, or homography).
   * **Bonus:** Distinguish between camera movement and object movement within the scene (e.g., use keypoint matching, estimate transformation matrices, etc.).
4. **Deployment:**

   * Wrap your solution in a small web app (**Streamlit, Gradio, or Flask**) that allows the user to upload a sequence of images (or a video), runs the detection, and displays the result.
   * Deploy the app on a public platform (**Vercel, Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces**, etc.)
5. **Deliverables:**

   * Public app URL
   * GitHub repo (with code and requirements.txt)
   * README (explaining your approach, dataset, and how to use the app)

     * **Sample README Outline:**

       * Overview of your approach and movement detection logic
       * Any challenges or assumptions
       * How to run the app locally
       * Link to the live app
       * Example input/output screenshots
   * AI Prompts or Chat History (if used for support)
