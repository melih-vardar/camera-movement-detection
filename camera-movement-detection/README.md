# Camera Movement Detection - ATP Core Talent 2025

**Detecting Significant Camera Movement Using Feature-Based Computer Vision**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements a camera movement detection system that distinguishes between actual camera shake/movement and object movements within the scene. The solution uses advanced computer vision techniques including feature detection, optical flow, and homography analysis.

### Key Features
- **Feature-based detection** using goodFeaturesToTrack + Lucas-Kanade optical flow
- **Camera vs Object movement distinction** through movement consistency analysis
- **Homography-based transformation analysis** for precise movement characterization
- **Web interface** with Streamlit for easy testing and demonstration
- **Video and image sequence support** with intelligent frame sampling

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Approach

### Algorithm Overview
1. **Feature Detection**: Extract corner features using `cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()`
2. **Optical Flow**: Track features between frames using Lucas-Kanade method
3. **Homography Estimation**: Calculate geometric transformation using RANSAC
4. **Movement Analysis**: Distinguish camera movement from object movement using:
   - **Inlier Ratio**: Camera movement affects most features globally (>70%)
   - **Movement Consistency**: Camera movement creates consistent feature displacement
   - **Transformation Parameters**: Analyze translation, scale, rotation, and perspective changes

### Core Detection Criteria
- **Translation**: Significant camera pan/tilt (>1.0px + consistency >0.3)
- **Scale Changes**: Zoom in/out detection (>0.02 + consistency >0.3)
- **Rotation**: Camera rotation detection (>0.01 rad + consistency >0.3)
- **Camera Shake**: High movement with very high consistency (>2.0px + >0.5 consistency)

## ðŸ§  Development Process

### Key Challenge: Distinguishing Camera vs Object Movement
**Problem**: Basic frame differencing detected any movement, including moving objects.

**Solution**: Implemented feature-based analysis with movement consistency metrics. Camera movement creates consistent feature displacement across the entire frame, while object movement creates localized, inconsistent patterns.

### Algorithm Refinement
Through testing and parameter adjustment, developed a multi-criteria detection system that significantly reduces false positives while maintaining high accuracy for actual camera movements.

### Key Assumptions
- **Sufficient Features**: Algorithm requires at least 10 corner features per frame for reliable detection
- **Frame Quality**: Input frames should have reasonable resolution and contrast for feature detection
- **Sequential Analysis**: Frames are analyzed in sequence, comparing consecutive frames for movement detection
- **Movement Types**: Optimized for detecting pan, tilt, zoom, rotation, and shake movements
